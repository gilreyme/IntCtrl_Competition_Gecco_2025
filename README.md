# IntCtrl_Competition_Gecco_2025
Proposal for the Interpretable Control Competition. Interpretable learning and control using a PIDA (Proportional-Integral-Derivative-Accelerative) controller in the Atari Pong environment. The controller is designed to operate under a discrete action space and uses visual information from the game's rendered frames to identify relevant game objects. We propose a multi-objective optimization of the PIDA parameters to balance three key goals: maximizing match duration, maximizing goals scored, and minimizing goals conceded. The optimization process is performed externally using multi-objective optimization in MATLAB, interfaced via CSV-based communication. The resulting Pareto front enables the exploration of diverse behavioral trade-offs.
